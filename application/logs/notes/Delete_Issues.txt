Tables where delete functions don't work:
    Key Lists
    Authorized Keys
    Authorized Presets

These tables allow multiple entries for multiple fields. For example: one UID might have access to several key lists, and one key list 
might be accessed by several people so passing either field into a delete function will result in more than one deleted value.
