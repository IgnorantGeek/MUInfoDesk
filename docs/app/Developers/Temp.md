<!--
This is a holder file for the developer directory. This folder will feature documentation of how the app functions from a developer
perspective, and will try to give future devs the ability to understand the app structure and allow them to make changes. Should
give the explainations of what the main functions we use are doing. Go over the MVC model, and give a detailed explanation of 
what each php file is doing. Probably don't need explanations for all the views as they are kinda self explanatory (they are the
html content that is being displayed to the user.)
