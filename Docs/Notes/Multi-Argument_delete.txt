Delete Issue:
    There is an issue when deleteing from certain tables. If there will be multiple entries of the same field (UID, listID), when you delete an entry
    it deletes all entries with that value. We need to fix the delete functions so that, in certain scenarios, they take two arguments and delete the 
    entry with those two arguments.
    Another idea would be to give each row a unique row id and then pass the row id to the delete function. Then we could essentially have one delete function
    in DatabaseView controller. Would be easier to use the delete functions already in place and modify them to delete the correct rowID. Need to modify the SQL
    Tables to get that to work
